# Project Name: The Last Supper

**What is the problem being solved / question being asked?**

* This game will playfully address the outcomes of food choices, providing subtle lessons on the impact of harmful yet common foods. The gameplay experience aims to convey the effects of various food options on one’s health, within a fun and engaging medium.

**What does the player get to do?**

* The player will get to pick food and utensil troops to place around a battlefield. They may also pick buffs, debuffs, and abilities to play as their troops battle it out to create the recipe. Once they select 
their troops and layout, they can press play and watch the troops battle it out.

**What are the constraints? What limitations will we place on the player**

* The player will have a fixed amount of currency which compels them to make strategic decisions regarding which units, troops, and enhancements to buy and where to position them. The player must prevent low-
quality or undesirable food items from entering the cooking pot or reaching the final destination.

* The largest constraint is that the player cannot affect the ‘food fight’ while it's happening, and must therefore think very strategically about the placement of units / troops.

**What are the Controls**

* We will be using the mouse as the main control for picking units, cards, placement, traversing the menu. Our secondary control is the keyboard with only a few keys doing things like resetting the turn or undoing 
the placement of the “troops”, or bringing up the pause menu.

**Any performance limits?**

* The game should have simplistic enough graphics and features so that most modern computers can run it. No Ray-traced reflections / lighting for this game!

**How will the command pattern be implemented?**

* We could implement the command pattern in multiple different ways. Most likely, we will give users the ability to undo purchases, placement of troops, or even to reset the entire level. 

**What assets will you need?**

* We will need 3D models and animations for all of the enemies and troops, which we can likely source for free. The cartoony and playful nature of the game also lends itself to simple animations which we could 
develop in house.

* We will also need some 2D assets for UI, as well as audio assets

**Who is assigned what roles?**

* Richard - All things numbers, balancing, enemy/troop design

* Alex - UI, audio, effects, troop behavior / movement

* Edgar - Troop behavior / movement, other gameplay features (action cards, etc)

* Note: Roles will likely evolve and change as development progresses and the teams strengths and weaknesses are better identified

**When will things be completed / what are your milestones?**

* 9/6: Player can move camera around in the world, can place troops

* 9/12: Troops walk around and will fight enemies

* 9/20: Currency / cards implemented, basic game functionality is done

* 9/27: Fully implement command pattern and polish

* 10/4: Game is done / meets minimum viable product standards

**What is your future ideas list?**

* Multiple stages and areas with unique foods and environments.

* Maps with unique conditions that causes food to mold, burn, or other

* Cumulative ‘health score’ that allows players to permanently purchase cosmetics or upgrades that persist for every level

* Boss battles with big processed food (a whole happy meal, microwavable meals, etc)

* Ability to use enemy ‘unhealthy’ foods on your own team in exchange for a tank in your final healthy score

* 1st person mode where the player can control one troop directly in battle
